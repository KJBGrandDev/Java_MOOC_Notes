There are two ways to create an Array. In the first one you have to explicitly define the size upon the creating. This is how you create an Array to hold three integers:

```Java
int[] numbers = new int[3];
```

An array is declared by adding square brackets after the type of the elements it contains (typeofelements[]). A new Array is created by calling `new` followed by the type of the elements, square brackets and the number of the elements in the square brackets.

An Array to hold 5 Strings can be created like this:
```Java
String[] strings = new String[5];
```
