Every programmer should know a bit about the structure of the memory used by a computer program. Each variable — let it be primitive or reference type — is saved in the memory. Each variable has size i.e. a defined number of bits (zeros and ones) it takes in the memory. The value of the variable is also represented in bits.

The reference of the array object is actually information about the location of the data. By stating `array[0]` we're referring to the first element of the array. The statement `array[0]` can also be read "Go to the beginning of the array and move forward 0 times the size of the variable contained in the array — and return a chunk of data the size of the variable.

The size of an int variable in java is 32 bits. One bit is reserved for the sign, so the largest possible number to present in int is 231-1. When you create an int array of 4 elements, 4 * 32 bits of memory is allocated to hold the integers. When you access `array[2]`, 32 bits are read starting from beginning of the array + 2 * 32 bits.

Some programming languages try to make sure that the programmer doesn't go "in the wrong area". If java didn't cause the exception when we say `array[-1]`, we would find the data located just before the array in the memory of the program. In such case there wouldn't be anything preventing us from writing a program reading the whole memory reserved for the program.
