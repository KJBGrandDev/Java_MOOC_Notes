You can create an array stating the type of the elements of the array followed by square brackets (typeofelements[]). Therefore the elements of the array can be of any type. Here's a few examples:
```Java
String[] months = new String[12];
double[] approximations = new double[100];

months[0] = "January";
approximations[0] = 3.14;
```
