### Learning Objectives

- Revising reading, printing and comparing Strings
- Knowing how to split a string into several pieces

Let's first revise what we already know about Strings and see how to split them. Below we create a String variable `magicWord`, that contains value `"abracadabra"`.

```Java
String magicWord = "abracadabra";
```

Passing a String as a parameter to a print command (or, for that matter, any method that takes a String parameter) happens in the familiar way:

```Java
String magicWord = "abracadabra";
System.out.println(magicWord);
```

```Java
abracadabra
```
