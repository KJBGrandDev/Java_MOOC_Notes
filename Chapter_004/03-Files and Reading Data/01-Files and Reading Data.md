A considerable amount of software is in one way or another based on handling data. Software created for playing music handles music files and those created for the purpose of image manipulation handle image files. Applications that run on the internet and mobile devices, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and Telegram, handle user information that is stored in file-based databases. What these all have in common is that they read and manipulate data in one way or another. Also, the data being handled is ultimately stored in some format in one or more files.
