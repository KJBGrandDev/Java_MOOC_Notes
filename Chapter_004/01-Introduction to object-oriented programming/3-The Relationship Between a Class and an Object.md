A class lays out a blueprint for any objects that are instantiated from it. Let's draw from an analogy from outside the world of computers. Detached houses are most likely familiar to most, and we can safely assume the existence of drawings somewhere that determine what exactly a detached house is to be like. A class is a blueprint. In other words, it specifies what kinds of objects can be instantiated from it:

Individual objects, detached houses in this case, are all created based on the same blueprints - they're instances of the same class. The states of individual objects, i.e., their attributes (such as the wall color, the building material of the roof, the color of its foundations, the doors' materials and color, ...) may all vary, however. The following is an "object of a detached-house class":
