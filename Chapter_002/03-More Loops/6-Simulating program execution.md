As the number of variables increases, understanding a program becomes harder. Simulating program execution can help in understanding it.

You can simulate program execution by drawing a table containing a column for each variable and condition of a program, and a separate space for program output. You then go through the source code line by line, and write down the changes to the state of the program (the values of each variable or condition), and the program output.

The values of variables `result` and `i` from the previous example have been written out onto the table below at each point the condition `i < 4` is evaluated.
