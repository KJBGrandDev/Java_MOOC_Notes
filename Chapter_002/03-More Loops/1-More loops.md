### Learning Objectives

- You're familiar with the condition of the `while` loop condition.
- You know how to use the `for` loop.
- You recognize situations where a `while` loop should be used and those where a `for` loop is more appropriate.

The "while-true" loop we've been using is very handy when the program has to repeat a functionality until the user provides certain input.

Next, we'll come to know a few other ways to implement loops.
