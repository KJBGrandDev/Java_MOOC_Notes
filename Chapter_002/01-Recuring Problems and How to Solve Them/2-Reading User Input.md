The solution pattern for programming tasks involving reading user input is straightforward. If the program needs to read from the user, a Scanner helper tool is created for the task. The Scanner is created in the main method after the line `public static void main(String[] args) {`. To use the Scanner, it needs to be made available in the program through the statement `import java.util.Scanner;`, which comes before the class definition (`public class ...`). Importing the Scanner tool makes it available for the program.

```java
// Making the scanner available in the program
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Program {
    public static void main(String[] main) {
        // Creating the scanner
        Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Examples of reading different types of user input
        String text = reader.nextLine();
        int number = Integer.valueOf(reader.nextLine());
        double numberWithDecimals = Double.valueOf(reader.nextLine());
        boolean trueOrFalse = Boolean.valueOf(reader.nextLine());

    }
}
```
