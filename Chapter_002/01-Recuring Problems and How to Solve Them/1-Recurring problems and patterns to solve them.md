### Learning Objectives

- You recognize that certain sub-problems, such as reading input or calculations, recur in programs.
- You're aware of solution models to certain sub-problems.
- You practice combining solution patterns used on sub-problems to solve broader ones.

The same small problems, or "sub-problems", reappear in programs time after time: "Read input from the user", "Calculate the sum of values", and so forth.

Let's look at a few sub-problems and patterns for solving them.
