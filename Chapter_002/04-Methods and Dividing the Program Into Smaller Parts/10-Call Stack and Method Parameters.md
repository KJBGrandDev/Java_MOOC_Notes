Let's examine the call stack in a situation where parameters have been defined for the method.
```Java
public static void main(String[] args){
	int beginning = 1;
	int end = 5;

	printStars(beginning, end);
}
public static void printStars(int beginning,int end){
	while(beginning>end){
		System.out.println"*");
		beginning++;
	}
}
```

The execution of the program begins on the first line of the `main` method. The next two lines create the variables `beginning` and `end`, and also assign values to them. The state of the program prior to calling the method `printStars`:

```Java
main 
	beginning = 1 
	end = 5
```

When `printStars` is called, the `main` method enters a waiting state. The method call causes new variables `beginning` and `end` to be created for the method `printStars`, to which the values passed as parameters are assigned to. These values are copied from the variables `beginning` and `end` of the `main` method. The state of the program on the first line of the execution of the method `printStars` is illustrated below.

```Java
printStars
	beginning = 1
	end = 5
main
	beginning = 1
	end = 5
```

When the command `beginning++` is executed within the loop, the value of the variable `beginning` that belongs to the method currently being executed changes.

```Java
printStars
	beginning = 2
	end = 5
main
	beginning = 1
	end = 5
```

As such, the values of the variables in the method `main` remain unchanged. The execution of the method `printStart` would continue for some time after this. When the execution of that method ends, the execution resumes inside the `main` method.

```Java  
main 
	beginning = 1 
	end = 5
```
