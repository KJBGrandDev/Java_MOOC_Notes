A variable's type is specified when it's initially declared. For example, a variable containing the string "text" is declared with the statement:
```Java
String string = "text";
```

And an integer having the value 42 is declared with the statement
```Java
int value = 42;
```

A variable's type determines the types of values that can be assigned to it.

"String" types hold text, "int" types hold whole numbers, "double" holds floating-point numbers, and "boolean" types hold either true or false.

As such, the possible values of a given variable type are limited. For example, a string cannot contain an integer, "nor" can a double contain a boolean value.
