The next exercises task you with calculating the average of the entered numbers. Let's briefly review the concept ofÂ _average_.

An average refers to the sum of numbers divided by their count. For instance, the average of the numbers 5 and 3 can be calculated with the formula (5+3)/2. Similarly, the average of the numbers 1, 2, and 4 is produced by the formula (1+2+4)/3.

In the context of programming, there are a few things to keep in mind. Firstly, dividing by zero is typically not permitted. This implies that calculating the average of zero numbers is impossible. Secondly, if the program handles both the sum of the numbers and their total count as integers, one (or both) of the variables should be casted to a floating-point number by multiplying it by 1.0 before the division.
