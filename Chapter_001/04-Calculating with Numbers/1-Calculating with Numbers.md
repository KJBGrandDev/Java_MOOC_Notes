The basic mathematical operations are both familiar and straightforward: addition `+`, subtraction `-`, multiplication `*`, and division `/`.

The precedence is also familiar: operations are performed from left to right with the parentheses taken into account.

Expressions involving `*` and `/` are calculated before those involving `+` and `-`, as is customary in elementary school mathematics.

```Java
int first = 2;
System.out.println(first) //prints 2
int second = 4;
System.out.println(second) //prints 4

int sum = first + second //The sum of the values of the variables first and second is assigned to the integer variable sum
System.out.println(sum) //prints 6
```
