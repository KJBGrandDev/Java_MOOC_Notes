Code in Java is indented either by four spaces or a single tab for each block. Use either spaces or tabs for indentation, not both. The indentation might break in some cases if you use both at the same time. NetBeans will help you with this if you hit the "alt + shift + f" (macOS "control + shift + f") key combination.

From now on the our program code needs to be indented correctly in the exercises as well. If the indentation is incorrect, the development environment will not accept the solution. You will see indentation errors highlighted in yellow in the test results.

The above error message says that there should have been 8 spaces at the beginning of line 8 - there were only 2. In this case, we can fix the indentation by adding 6 more spaces to the beginning of line 8.
