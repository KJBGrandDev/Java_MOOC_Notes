Source code can be commented to clarify or to add notes. There are two ways to do this.
- Single line comments are marked with two slashes " // ". Everything following them on the same line is interpreted as a comment
- Multi line comments are marked with a slash and an asterisk and closed with an asterisk followed by a slash. Everything between them is interpreted as a comment.
